## Welcome to Algo4all Repo

*Why build this*

1. All devs are now given algorithm tests and are force to learning different algorithms they will never use again.
2. Not everyone can afford leetcode
3. I like building stuffs out of the nowhereðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

*I will add explanations to each algo later*

I created a seperate server with fastify and node, since Fastify is faster than express. This is because i store all names in local storage on initial load so you wold only require fetching of data when you want to see a particular solution.

But this makes initial load time 4-8 seconds, depending on your internet.
